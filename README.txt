This website was created for the MLH Hackation Hackathon that took place 4th of July Weekend 2020.
The website represents a sample of the activities offered through the "My Staycation" Alexa Skill,
which hopefully should be available on the Alexa Store soon.

This is Lens, a full screen (and entirely responsive) photo gallery design. Unlike previous
designs I've done in this vein (Parallelism, for instance), this one eschews the usual
lightbox in favor of a completely full screen experience -- one that I'm happy to say
translates awesomely all the way down to the tiniest of mobile devices. Full instructions
below!
